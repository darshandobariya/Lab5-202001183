Static Analysis:
    Static analysis is a method of examining the source code of a software program without
    executing it. Static analysis can help detect errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues
    in the code. Static analysis tools can perform various tasks such as checking syntax, style,
    logic, data flow, control flow, and security. Static analysis can improve the reliability,
    performance, and maintainability of software by identifying and correcting defects early in the
    development process.
Static Analysis Tools:
    Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without
    executing it. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and
    other quality issues in their code. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the
    code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation. Static
    analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the
    version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline. Some examples of static analysis
    tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.
List of tools:
    Python:
        ● Mypy
        ● Pylint
        ● Pyflakes
        ● Pycodestyle (pep8)
        ● Flake8
        ● Prospector
        ● Bandit
    Java:
        ● FindBugs
        ● PMD
        ● Checkstyle
        ● Error Prone
        ● Spoon
        ● Spotbugs
Select the tool of your choice. Select a git repository, use the selected tool and analyze the files
from the selected repository. Submit the tool output and understanding of the errors.

Hear given tools i use mypy.
Steps:
    A)Frist i install mypy.
    B)Now i check the errors in the given python files.
    C)Check the first file with mypy and check is there any error present or not.
    D)Check the second file with mypy and check is there any error present or not.
    E)Check the third file with mypy and check is there any error present or not.
